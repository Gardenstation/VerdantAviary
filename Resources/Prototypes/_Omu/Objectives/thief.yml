# This objective exists to encourage cybernetic beasts to play differently around their mantle. The objective should not pop up super often, as it's in the pool
# with the rest of the objectives, and having your mantle stolen once or twice is probably enough to make you play differently. You may decide to wear your
# mantle more often so that you notice when it get stolen, or you may choose to accept the downsides of not wearing your mantle in order to keep it hidden.
# In any case, the existance of this objective forces players to play differently based on the trait that they've chosen. And I think that's the most interesting
# thing that a trait can do.
