trait-language-BieselEckeckyik-desc =
     A more humanized dialect of the Thaven common language, thought to be developed by Thaven dockworkers in the coastal cities of Biesel.
     The dialect relies less heavily on subsonics and manipulation of frequencies, with a larger emphasis on harmonics, whooping hollers, and sing-song vocalizations.
     Its speakers range from Thaven immigrants, sympathetic co-workers, and overbearing foremen with bad accents.
