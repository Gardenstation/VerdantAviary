The Verdant Aviary is a fork from [Omu Station](https://github.com/ProjectOmu/OmuStation), originally forked from [Goob Station](https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station), a primary fork from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). To prevent people forking [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server, this is the content pack for Verdant Aviary.

Gardenstation and by extension, The Verdant Aviary, is about building a truly immersive and cohesive roleplay experience and world. We plan to bring new and wholly unique features and experiences to the game, ensuring each department can have their time in the spotlight and every player be provided the tools they need to tell the stories they want to.

Gardenstation and the Verdant Aviary are built on community and collective work, anyone that believes in the vision is welcome to join us in realizing the work! Remember- The Garden can only grow if YOU water it!

If you want to host or create content for SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.

## Documentation/Wiki

The Goob Station [docs site](https://docs.goobstation.com/) has documentation on GS14's content, engine, game design, and more. It also has lots of resources for new contributors to the project; this website is great for use, and because we are so closely related to Goob Station, we suggest checking them out! They are part of our upstream alongside Omu, and we will be taking certain changes and additions from them.
